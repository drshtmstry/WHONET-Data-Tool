# WHONET Data Tool

<p>High-performance, open-source utility for inspecting, deduplicating, sorting, and analyzing WHONET SQLite databases.</p>
<p><a href="https://whonet-tool.vercel.app/"><strong>whonet-tool.vercel.app</strong></a></p>

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All data is processed **locally** — nothing is uploaded to any cloud server. Verify all generated figures before submitting to any surveillance body.

## Features

- **Deduplication** — Identify and resolve duplicate isolates clustered by `SPEC_NUM` (Specimen #) or `PATIENT_ID` with batch selection and deletion.
- **Natural Column Sorting** — Interactive click-to-sort headers with intelligent alphanumeric ordering for specimen numbers (e.g. `CSR-1`, `CSR-2`, `CSR-10`, `CSR-151`, `-1/-2`, `-A/-B` suffixes) across Isolates, Duplicates, and SQL Workspace.
- **Monthly AMR Surveillance Report** — Standard National AMR Containment C&S reporting matrix (OPD/IPD/ICU × specimen type) with instant TSV clipboard copy and CSV export.
- **Interactive Visual Analytics** — Real-time Chart.js distribution charts (Organisms, Specimen Types, Wards, Age Groups, Gender, AMR Phenotypes) with dynamic date range filtering and single/dual view toggles.
- **In-Place Record Corrections** — Clean, inline field editing and full-record correction modals with immediate database sync.
- **Bulk Data Cleansing** — One-click uppercase specimen normalization and whitespace sanitation.
- **Intelligent SQL Console** — Built-in query editor with schema-aware autocomplete, keyboard shortcuts, and instant result table sorting.
- **Dual Runtime Architecture** — Runs either completely client-side in the browser via the In-Browser Engine (`sql.js`), or locally via Node.js native `DatabaseSync` (`node:sqlite`).

## Usage

### Web / PWA App (In-Browser Engine (Client-side))
Open **[whonet-tool.vercel.app](https://whonet-tool.vercel.app/)** in Chrome or Edge (or click the browser address bar icon to install as a desktop/mobile app):
- **Direct Folder Access**: Connect your local data folder once (`C:\WHONET\Data`) → the browser remembers the link and saves changes straight to disk.
- **Preloaded Sample Data**: Test immediately with bundled sample databases (`WHO-TST-2020-01.sqlite`, etc.).
- **100% Private On-Device Processing**: The database engine runs directly inside your browser; zero patient data is uploaded to any cloud server.

### Local SQLite Server (Node.js) Mode
1. Install [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/) (v22+ recommended)
2. Run `Start-WHONET.bat` or use the command line:
   ```bash
   npm start              # run local Node server on http://localhost:7890 (with auto-restart)
   ```
3. Browser automatically opens at `http://localhost:7890`.
4. Reads `.sqlite` files directly from `C:\WHONET\Data`. Mutations save straight to disk with on-demand connection locking.

### Web / PWA Mode (Vercel)
For client-side Vite testing and building:
```bash
npm run web:dev        # launch in-browser WASM dev server
npm run web:build      # compile production bundle for Vercel (/dist)
npm run web:preview    # preview production build locally
```
